# Agricultural-Website-MahaSetakariKalya-aSa-gha-ana-
The main objective of this project is building a website which will help  farmers in Maharashtra to make the effective cultivation by providing up-to-date  information and make a path to earn more money from villages in Maharashtra. Information and communication have always mattered in agriculture. Ever  since people have grown crops, raised livestock, and caught fish, they have sought information from one another. Where can I buy the improved seed or feed this year?  Who is paying the highest price at the market? How can I participate in the  government’s credit program? Where can I get today’s market rates? How can I get  latest news? Which are the new businesses? Producers rarely find it easy to obtain  answers to such questions, even if similar ones arise season after season. Farmers in  a village may have planted the “same” crop for centuries, but over time, weather  patterns and soil conditions change and epidemics of pests and diseases come and  go. Updated information allows the farmers to cope with and even benefit from these  changes. Providing such knowledge can be challenging, however, because the highly  localized nature of agriculture means that information must be tailored specifically  to distinct conditions
